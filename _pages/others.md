## Courses and Projects during my Master's in Data Science
Following is a list of courses and projects/skills I gained during my Master's in Data Science.

| Course Name         | Learning/Project/Skills          |
|------------------|----------------------|
|MSSC 5650 Theory of Optimization| Learned advanced optimization (unconstrained) techniques. Check out my [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 1](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization1-blog/) and [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 2](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization2-blog/) which I wrote by learnings from the course|
|COSC 6330 Advanced Machine Learning| Learned machine learning algorithms and this course focused a lot on mathmatical rigor. As a part of this course, the project I did was published in [MLSP 2023](https://graph-based-mtl-fault-detection.github.io/)| 


## Coursera Certifications
As I come from a EECE background, I had no formal exposure to deep learning/machine learning/data science in my undergrad. I taught myself these topics by completing certification course offered through Coursera. See below a list of certifications I got in during undergrad:

| Title            | Certificate          |
