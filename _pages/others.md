## Coursera Certifications
As I come from a EECE background, I had no formal exposure to deep learning/machine learning/data science in my undergrad.  
I taught myself these topics by completing certification course offered through Coursera. See below a list of certifications I got in my undergrad:

| Title            | Description          |                             
|------------------|----------------------|
