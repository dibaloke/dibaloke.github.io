## Courses and Projects during my Master's in Data Science
Following is a list of courses and projects/skills I gained during my Master's in Data Science.

| Course Name         | Learning/Project/Skills          |
|------------------|----------------------|
|MSSC 5650<br><b>Theory of Optimization</b>| This course inspired the following two blogs [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 1](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization1-blog/) and [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 2](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization2-blog/)|
|COSC 6330<br><b>Advanced Machine Learning</b>| The project I did as a part of this course was later published in [MLSP 2023](https://graph-based-mtl-fault-detection.github.io/)| 
| MSSC 6040 <br> <b>Applied Linear Algebra</b>| This course inspired me to create the [Linear Algebra](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/Linear-Algebra/) blog|
| MSSC 5790<br><b>Bayesian Statistics</b>|This was a introductory course in Bayesian stats. This course helped me to include some new distributions to my [blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/a-reference-guide-to-distributions-blog/) | 
|COSC 6520 <b>Data Analytics</b>| I was introduced to R programming language in this course |
| MSSC 6250<br><b>Statistical Machine Learning</b> | Checkout my final project write-up <a href="https://dibaloke.github.io/files/MSSC_6250_Project_Dibaloke.pdf" target="_blank"> "Explainability of Machine Learning Models using Co-operative Game Theory"</a> and the Github repo| 
| COSC 6820<br> <b> Data Ethics </b> | Checkout my final project write-up <a href="https://dibaloke.github.io/files/Final_Paper_Data_Ethics_Dibaloke.pdf" target="_blank"> "Generative AI: Ethical Challenges and Prevention Strategies with Watermarking and Traceability"</a> for this course|
|COSC 5500 <br> <b> Visual Analytics </b> | I learned how to make dashboards with tools like Tableau. Check out my [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/DibalokeChandaVisualAnalyticsSpring2024TableauProject_3/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) where I visual crime data and Airbnb listing in Chicago area. As a final project, I used Rshiny to create an interactive app, see the GitHub repo for that.|

## Coursera Certifications
As I come from an EECE background, I had no formal exposure to deep learning/machine learning/data science in my undergrad. I taught myself these topics by completing certification courses offered through Coursera. See below a list of certifications I got during undergrad:

| Title            | Certificate          |
