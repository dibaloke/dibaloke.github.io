## Courses and Projects during my Master's in Data Science
Following is a list of courses and projects/skills I gained during my Master's in Data Science.

| Course Name         | Learning/Project/Skills          |
|------------------|----------------------|
|MSSC 5650 <br>Theory of Optimization| This course inspired the following two blogs [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 1](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization1-blog/) and [Prerequisites for Convex Optimization 2](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/Prerequisites-for-Convex-Optimization2-blog/)|
|COSC 6330 <br> Advanced Machine Learning| The project I did as a part of this course was later published in [MLSP 2023](https://graph-based-mtl-fault-detection.github.io/)| 
| MSSC 6040 <br> Applied Linear Algebra| This course inspired me to create the [Linear Algebra] blog|
| MSSC 5790 <br> Bayesian Statistics|This was a introductory course in Bayesian stats. This course helped me to include some new distributions to my [blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/a-reference-guide-to-distributions-blog/) | 


## Coursera Certifications
As I come from a EECE background, I had no formal exposure to deep learning/machine learning/data science in my undergrad. I taught myself these topics by completing certification course offered through Coursera. See below a list of certifications I got in during undergrad:

| Title            | Certificate          |
