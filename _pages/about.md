I am a graduate student at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/), affiliated with the Machine Learning, Optimization and Data (MOD) lab.

I am interested in all topics in machine and deep learning with most experience in computer vision and graph neural networks. My current research focuses on vision+x models and their interpretability.

Previously I was a lecturer in the Electrical, Electronic and Communication (EECE) department of the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST).
