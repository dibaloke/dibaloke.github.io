I am a graduate student at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) in the computer science department.

My current research focuses on Vision+X models in computational pathology and how to interpret their predictions through explainability algorithms. I am also interested in foundation models, unsupervised pre-training schemes, generative AI, LLMs and adversarial attacks.

Previously, I was a lecturer in the Electrical, Electronic, and Communication (EECE) department, [MIST](https://mist.ac.bd/).

# Technical Write-ups
I maintain several technical blogs where I write about topics in deep learning and machine learning.

- [Main Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/): My main blog where I cover all sorts of topic including deep learning architectures, Pytorch, statistics, machine learning, etc.
- [Linear Algebra Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/Linear-Algebra/): My Linear Algebra blog where I keep my lecture notes regarding linear algera.

I have a habit of curating courses in deep learning and related resources. Check out this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dibaloke/DL-ML-Courses/tree/main) for that. I also have a habit of curating technical blog posts on deep learning-related topics. Check out this [Github repo](https://github.com/dibaloke/DL-ML-Blogs) for that. I also have a [repository](https://github.com/dibaloke/others) where I curate other interesting stuff I find about deep learning, stats and math which includes interactive websites and publicly available books and e-books.
