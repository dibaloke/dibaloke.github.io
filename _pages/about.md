I am a graduate student at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/), affiliated with the Machine Learning, Optimization and Data (MOD) lab.

I am interested in all topics in machine and deep learning with most experience in computer vision and graph neural networks. My current research focuses on vision+x models and their interpretability.

Previously I was a lecturer in the Electrical, Electronic and Communication (EECE) department of the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST).

# Technical Write-ups
I maintain several technical blogs where I write about topics in deep learning and machine learning.

- [Main Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/): My main blog where I cover all sorts of topic including deep learning architectures, Pytorch, statistics, machine learning, etc.
- [Linear Algebra Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/Linear-Algebra/): My Linear Algebra blog where I keep my lecture notes regarding linear algera.
