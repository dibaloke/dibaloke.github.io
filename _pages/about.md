I am a graduate student at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/).

I have a keen interest in exploring all areas within the machine and deep learning. However, I have most experience in computer vision and graph neural networks. My current research focuses on vision+x models and their interpretability. At the moment I am exploring vision+x models used in computational pathology and how to understand their predictions.

Previously I was a lecturer in the Electrical, Electronic and Communication (EECE) department, [MIST](https://mist.ac.bd/).

# Technical Write-ups
I maintain several technical blogs where I write about topics in deep learning and machine learning.

- [Main Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/): My main blog where I cover all sorts of topic including deep learning architectures, Pytorch, statistics, machine learning, etc.
- [Linear Algebra Blog](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/Linear-Algebra/): My Linear Algebra blog where I keep my lecture notes regarding linear algera.

I have a habit of curating courses in deep learning and related resources. Check out this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dibaloke/DL-ML-Courses/tree/main) for that. I also have a habit of curating technical blog posts on deep learning-related topics. Check out this [Github repo](https://github.com/dibaloke/DL-ML-Blogs) for that. I also have a [repository](https://github.com/dibaloke/others) where I curate other interesting stuff I find about deep learning, stats and math which includes interactive websites and publicly available books and e-books.
